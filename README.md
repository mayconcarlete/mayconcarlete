## Maycon Carlete
Hello there! My name is Maycon, I'm graduated in Mechanical Engineering. After a many years working as private tutor in courses like: Arduino, C Programming, Differential and Integral Calculus and Physics. I decided that was time to move on and focus my career only with my passion, design softwares.
